# Kubernetes Secrets Store CSI Driver

Secrets Store CSI driver for Kubernetes secrets - Integrates secrets stores with Kubernetes via a [Container Storage Interface (CSI)](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/) volume.

The Secrets Store CSI driver `secrets-store.csi.k8s.io` allows Kubernetes to mount multiple secrets, keys, and certs stored in enterprise-grade external secrets stores into their pods as a volume. Once the Volume is attached, the data in it is mounted into the container's file system.
